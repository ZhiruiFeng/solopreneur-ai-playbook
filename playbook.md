# The Solopreneur AI Playbook
## The Strategic Guide to Running a One-Person Business with AI

> This isn't a prompt collection — it's a playbook. Strategy first, then the tools to execute it. Each section gives you the framework for *thinking* about your business, then the AI automations to *move faster* once you've decided what to do.

# Part 1: The Solopreneur Operating System

Before you copy a single prompt, you need to understand the system you're building. Most solopreneurs fail not because they lack tactics, but because they lack structure. This section gives you that structure.

## The 4-Lever Framework

Every solopreneur business runs on exactly four levers. When revenue stalls, one of these is the bottleneck:

| Lever | What It Controls | Key Question |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Offer** | What you sell and how it's packaged | Is my offer clear, valuable, and priced correctly? |
| **Audience** | Who knows about you | Am I reaching enough of the right people? |
| **Conversion** | Turning attention into revenue | Are interested people actually buying? |
| **Delivery** | Fulfilling what you sold | Can I deliver profitably without burning out? |

**How to use this:** Every Monday, ask yourself which lever is your current constraint. Then spend 80% of your discretionary time on that ONE lever. Most solopreneurs spread effort across all four and wonder why nothing moves.

### Diagnosing Your Bottleneck

```
IF you have paying clients who love your work BUT you're not growing
→ Your bottleneck is AUDIENCE. Focus on visibility.

IF people engage with your content BUT don't buy
→ Your bottleneck is CONVERSION. Fix your offer positioning or sales process.

IF you're getting sales calls BUT losing deals on price or scope
→ Your bottleneck is OFFER. Repackage or reprice.

IF you're winning deals BUT drowning in delivery
→ Your bottleneck is DELIVERY. Systematize, raise prices, or narrow scope.

IF you have no idea where clients come from
→ Start with AUDIENCE. Nothing else matters without attention.
```

### Revenue Math Every Solopreneur Should Know

Before you build anything, do this math:

```
Monthly Revenue Target: $________

÷ Average Project Value: $________ = Projects Needed Per Month: ________

× Average Close Rate (typically 25-40%): ________ = Sales Conversations Needed: ________

× Lead-to-Call Rate (typically 10-20%): ________ = Leads Needed Per Month: ________
```

**Example:** $10,000/month ÷ $2,500/project = 4 projects. At a 30% close rate, you need ~13 sales conversations. At a 15% lead-to-call rate, you need ~87 leads per month, or about 3 per day.

Now you know what "enough marketing" actually looks like. Most solopreneurs either do too little (hoping for magic) or too much (random acts of content). This math gives you a target.

## The Time-Value Matrix

Not all hours are equal. Here's how to audit where your time goes:

| | **High Skill Required** | **Low Skill Required** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Revenue Impact** | 🟢 **YOUR ZONE** — Do this yourself, protect this time fiercely (client strategy, sales calls, core creative work) | 🟡 **SYSTEMATIZE** — Build a template/SOP, then delegate (proposals, onboarding, invoicing) |
| **Low Revenue Impact** | 🟠 **QUESTION IT** — Is this actually necessary? Often ego work disguised as productivity (custom everything, over-engineering) | 🔴 **ELIMINATE OR DELEGATE** — AI or a VA should do this yesterday (email sorting, scheduling, data entry, formatting) |

**Action step:** Track your time for one week. Categorize every hour into one of these four quadrants. Most solopreneurs discover 40-60% of their time is in the bottom row. That's your AI opportunity.

## The Pricing Ladder

Most solopreneurs have ONE offer at ONE price. This is a revenue ceiling. Build a ladder:

```
LEVEL 5: Premium/Retainer    $5,000+/month    (1-3 clients max)
    ↑ Ongoing strategic partnership, priority access
    
LEVEL 4: Done-For-You        $3,000-10,000    (your core offer)  
    ↑ Full-service delivery, your expertise applied to their problem
    
LEVEL 3: Done-With-You       $500-2,000       (leveraged time)
    ↑ Coaching, consulting, workshops — your guidance, their execution
    
LEVEL 2: Templates/Tools     $50-500          (passive-ish income)
    ↑ Productized knowledge — courses, templates, frameworks
    
LEVEL 1: Free Content        $0               (audience building)
    ↑ Blog posts, social media, newsletter — proves your expertise
```

**The strategy:** Level 1 builds your audience. Levels 2-3 serve people who can't afford Level 4. Level 4 is your bread and butter. Level 5 is where the real money is.

You don't need all five right now. But you should know which ones you're building toward.

# Part 2: AI Automations — Communication & Email

Now that you have the strategic framework, here are the tools to execute faster. Each automation below is ready to copy, paste, and customize.

**How to use the prompts:**
1. Replace the `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your specific details
2. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
3. Review, tweak, and use the output — never send AI output unedited

### 1. The Cold Email That Actually Gets Replies

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–30 minutes per email

**When to use:** You need to reach out to a potential client, partner, or collaborator and want something better than "I hope this finds you well."

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a cold email from me to [RECIPIENT NAME AND TITLE] at [THEIR COMPANY].

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME] — [1 SENTENCE DESCRIBING WHAT YOU DO]

What I want from this email: [SPECIFIC GOAL — e.g., "book a 15-minute call," "propose a collaboration," "get them to try my service"]

Something specific about them I noticed: [SOMETHING YOU GENUINELY OBSERVED — e.g., "they just launched a new product line," "their website doesn't have X," "they posted about struggling with Y"]

My tone: [CASUAL / PROFESSIONAL / FRIENDLY-BUT-DIRECT]

Rules:
- Keep it under 120 words
- No generic flattery — reference the specific thing I noticed
- One clear call to action at the end
- No "I hope this email finds you well" or similar filler
- Subject line that creates curiosity without being clickbait
- Write 3 subject line options and 1 email body
```

**💡 Pro tip:** The "something specific I noticed" is what makes or breaks cold emails. Spend 2 minutes on their LinkedIn or website before running this — it's the difference between a 2% and 20% reply rate.

---

### 2. The Inbox Triage Assistant

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes per batch

**When to use:** You've got 15+ unread emails piling up and need to quickly decide what matters, what can wait, and what to delete.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
I'm going to paste a batch of email subjects and senders below. For each one, categorize it as:

🔴 URGENT — needs reply today
🟡 THIS WEEK — important but not time-sensitive
🟢 BATCH — can handle during weekly admin time
🗑️ IGNORE — unsubscribe or delete

Context about my business: [1-2 SENTENCES ABOUT WHAT YOU DO AND WHO YOUR CLIENTS ARE]

My current priorities this week: [YOUR TOP 2-3 PRIORITIES]

After categorizing, draft a 2-3 sentence reply for each 🔴 URGENT email.

Here are the emails:
[PASTE EMAIL SUBJECTS AND SENDERS — e.g., "From: Sarah Chen, Subject: Quick question about the proposal deadline"]
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Do this first thing in the morning with yesterday's emails. You'll handle your inbox in 5 minutes instead of letting it consume your first productive hour.

---

### 3. The Meeting Follow-Up Writer

**⏱ Time saved:** 10–15 minutes per meeting

**When to use:** You just finished a call or meeting and need to send a professional follow-up while everything is still fresh.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a follow-up email after a meeting I just had.

Who I met with: [PERSON'S NAME AND ROLE]
What we discussed: [YOUR ROUGH NOTES — bullet points fine, even messy notes work]
What was decided or agreed on: [KEY DECISIONS OR NEXT STEPS]
What I need them to do next: [THEIR ACTION ITEMS]
What I committed to doing: [YOUR ACTION ITEMS]
Deadline or timeline discussed: [ANY DATES MENTIONED]

Write the email so it:
- Opens with a brief thank you (1 sentence, not gushing)
- Summarizes the key points in bullet format
- Clearly lists who is doing what by when
- Ends with a specific next step
- Stays under 200 words
- Tone: [WARM AND PROFESSIONAL / CASUAL / FORMAL]
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Voice-memo your rough notes immediately after the call ends, then paste the transcript here. Sending a follow-up within 30 minutes makes you look incredibly organized.

---

### 4. The Difficult Conversation Drafter

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–45 minutes (plus emotional energy)

**When to use:** You need to push back on a client, address a late payment, decline a request, or handle any awkward business communication.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me write a [EMAIL / MESSAGE / SCRIPT FOR A CALL] for a difficult conversation.

The situation: [DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED — e.g., "Client is 3 weeks late on payment," "A vendor delivered work that doesn't match what we agreed on," "I need to fire a subcontractor"]

What I want to achieve: [YOUR IDEAL OUTCOME — e.g., "Get paid within 7 days," "Get revisions without damaging the relationship," "End the contract cleanly"]

What I want to avoid: [e.g., "Sounding aggressive," "Burning the bridge," "Coming across as a pushover"]

Our relationship context: [e.g., "They're a long-term client," "This is our first project together," "They were referred by someone important to me"]

My communication style: [DIRECT / DIPLOMATIC / SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN]

Write the message so it:
- Acknowledges the situation without blame language
- States what I need clearly
- Gives them a face-saving path forward
- Includes a specific deadline or next step
- Keeps the door open for the relationship (unless I say otherwise)
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Run this prompt twice — once as "diplomatic" and once as "direct." The right version is usually somewhere between the two. These emails always feel harder to write than they actually are.

---

### 5. The Client Update Email

**⏱ Time saved:** 10–15 minutes per update

**When to use:** You need to keep a client in the loop on project progress without spending forever writing a status email.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a client update email for an ongoing project.

Client name: [CLIENT NAME]
Project: [PROJECT NAME OR BRIEF DESCRIPTION]

What's been completed since last update:
[YOUR NOTES — e.g., "finished homepage design, sent invoice for phase 1, got hosting set up"]

What's in progress now:
[YOUR NOTES — e.g., "working on about page, waiting on their logo files"]

Any blockers or things I need from them:
[e.g., "Still need their brand guidelines," "Waiting on approval for the mockup I sent Tuesday"]

Upcoming milestones or deadlines:
[e.g., "Phase 2 delivery expected March 10"]

Overall project health: [ON TRACK / SLIGHTLY BEHIND / AHEAD OF SCHEDULE]

Write it so it:
- Uses bullet points for easy scanning
- Highlights anything they need to act on (bold it)
- Is reassuring and confident in tone
- Stays under 200 words
- Doesn't over-explain technical details they don't care about
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Send these every Friday afternoon even when there's nothing dramatic to report. Clients who feel informed almost never become difficult clients. Silence breeds anxiety.

---

### 6. The Referral Request Message

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes per message

**When to use:** A project just wrapped up successfully and you want to ask your happy client for referrals without sounding desperate or salesy.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a referral request message to a client I just finished working with.

Client name: [CLIENT NAME]
What I did for them: [BRIEF PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
A specific result or win from our work together: [e.g., "Their website traffic increased 40%," "We delivered 2 weeks early," "They said they loved the rebrand"]
How I'd like to be referred: [e.g., "Introduction via email," "Tag me if someone in their network needs X," "Share my name with their industry peers"]
The type of client I'm looking for: [DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL NEXT CLIENT]

Write a [EMAIL / LINKEDIN MESSAGE / TEXT MESSAGE] that:
- Opens by referencing our positive experience together (specific, not generic)
- Makes the ask feel natural, not transactional
- Tells them exactly what kind of person to refer (so they can think of someone specific)
- Makes it easy — suggest they can just forward this email or make an intro
- Is warm and grateful without being over-the-top
- Stays under 150 words
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Timing matters more than wording. Send this within 48 hours of delivering final results, while the positive feelings are fresh. If you wait a month, even the best message falls flat.

# Part 3: AI Automations — Content & Marketing

---

### 7. The Weekly Content Idea Generator

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–45 minutes per week

**When to use:** It's content planning day and you're staring at a blank page wondering what to post this week.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Generate 10 content ideas for my business this week.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME] — [WHAT YOU DO]
My audience: [WHO YOU SERVE — e.g., "small business owners who need bookkeeping help"]
Platform(s) I post on: [e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, newsletter, Twitter]
My content goal right now: [e.g., "attract new leads," "build authority," "nurture existing audience"]

Things happening in my world right now that could inspire content:
- [e.g., "I just finished a big project," "A client asked me a great question," "I noticed a trend in my industry"]

Topics I've posted about recently (so we don't repeat):
- [LIST 3-5 RECENT TOPICS]

For each idea, give me:
1. A working title or hook (the first line people would see)
2. The key point or takeaway (1 sentence)
3. Format suggestion (carousel, text post, short video script, story, newsletter)
4. A "spicy take" option — a version of this idea that's more opinionated or contrarian

Make the ideas specific to MY business, not generic marketing advice.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Pick 3 of the 10 and schedule them immediately. The other 7 go in a "content bank" doc for slow weeks. Batching ideas and execution on different days is how you stay consistent without burnout.

---

### 8. The LinkedIn Post Writer

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–30 minutes per post

**When to use:** You know what you want to say but need help turning your rough idea into a post that people actually stop scrolling for.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post based on this idea:

The idea or story: [YOUR ROUGH IDEA — e.g., "I want to talk about how I lost a client because I underpriced my services and what I learned"]

The one thing I want the reader to take away: [THE CORE MESSAGE]

My target reader: [WHO SHOULD CARE ABOUT THIS — e.g., "freelance designers in their first 2 years"]

My voice on LinkedIn is: [e.g., "conversational and honest," "professional but not stuffy," "bold and opinionated"]

Write the post so it:
- Opens with a hook that stops the scroll (first 2 lines are everything)
- Uses short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max) for mobile readability
- Includes a specific example, story, or number (not just abstract advice)
- Ends with a question or call to engage (not "agree?" — something thoughtful)
- Is between 150-250 words
- Does NOT use hashtags, emojis in every line, or "I'm excited to announce" energy
- Feels like a real person sharing a real insight, not a content creator performing

Write 2 versions: one storytelling approach and one "hot take" approach.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Read your post out loud before publishing. If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite it. If it sounds like something you'd say to a smart friend over coffee, ship it.

---

### 9. The Newsletter Writer

**⏱ Time saved:** 45–60 minutes per newsletter

**When to use:** Newsletter day is here and you need to go from scattered notes to a polished email your subscribers actually want to read.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write my weekly newsletter based on the notes below.

Newsletter name: [YOUR NEWSLETTER NAME]
Audience: [WHO READS IT — e.g., "200 small business owners interested in marketing tips"]
My newsletter style: [e.g., "One big idea with practical takeaway," "3-5 curated links with my commentary," "Personal story + lesson"]

This week's topic or theme: [MAIN TOPIC]

My raw notes and thoughts:
[PASTE YOUR MESSY NOTES, BULLET POINTS, VOICE MEMO TRANSCRIPT — ANYTHING YOU HAVE]

Links or resources I want to include (if any):
[URLs OR DESCRIPTIONS]

Structure it as:
1. Subject line (write 3 options — one curiosity-driven, one benefit-driven, one contrarian)
2. Opening hook (2-3 sentences that make them want to keep reading)
3. Main body (the meat — organized, scannable, valuable)
4. One clear takeaway or action step
5. Sign-off with a personal touch or question to drive replies

Keep total length under 500 words. My readers are busy — respect their time.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** The subject line is 80% of whether your newsletter gets opened. Always write it last, after you know exactly what the email delivers. And test: reply-worthy newsletters grow faster than any growth hack.

---

### 10. The Case Study / Testimonial Crafter

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–45 minutes per case study

**When to use:** You have a great client result but need to turn it into a compelling story for your website, social media, or sales materials.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create a case study from the following project details.

Client (or anonymized description): [CLIENT NAME or "a mid-size e-commerce brand"]
Their industry: [INDUSTRY]
What they came to me for: [THE PROBLEM OR GOAL]
What the situation looked like before we worked together: [THE "BEFORE" — pain points, struggles, what wasn't working]
What I did for them: [YOUR PROCESS — keep it simple, focus on 2-3 key things]
The results: [SPECIFIC OUTCOMES — numbers, timeframes, qualitative feedback]
A direct quote from the client (if available): [PASTE QUOTE or "make up a realistic placeholder I can replace"]

Create 3 versions:
1. **Website case study** (250-350 words) — Problem → Solution → Result format with a compelling headline
2. **Social media post** (150 words) — Story-driven, conversational, ends with engagement prompt
3. **One-liner testimonial** — A punchy single sentence I can use anywhere

For all versions:
- Lead with the result, not the process
- Use specific numbers wherever possible
- Make the client the hero, not me
- Avoid jargon — a stranger should understand the impact
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Always ask clients for permission before publishing, even if you anonymize details. Better yet, send them the draft and ask "Does this capture our work together well?" — they'll often add even better quotes.

---

### 11. The SEO Blog Post Outliner

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–40 minutes per post

**When to use:** You want to write a blog post that actually ranks on Google and brings you traffic, not just a diary entry no one finds.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create a detailed blog post outline optimized for search.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME] — [WHAT YOU DO]
Target keyword or topic: [THE MAIN KEYWORD — e.g., "how to price freelance design work"]
Who I'm writing this for: [TARGET READER AND WHAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH]
My unique angle or experience: [WHAT MAKES MY TAKE DIFFERENT — e.g., "I've tested 4 pricing models over 6 years"]

Create an outline with:
1. SEO title (under 60 characters, includes the keyword naturally)
2. Meta description (under 155 characters, compelling reason to click)
3. Opening paragraph strategy (what hook to use — NOT the actual paragraph)
4. H2 and H3 heading structure (8-12 sections)
5. For each section: 2-3 bullet points on what to cover
6. Where to include personal examples or stories (mark these)
7. Internal/external linking opportunities
8. A "People Also Ask" section — 4-5 related questions to answer in the post
9. Call to action for the conclusion

Also suggest:
- 3 related keywords to weave in naturally
- Ideal word count for this topic
- 1 content upgrade idea (lead magnet) to capture emails from this post
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Write the outline first, then write the post in a separate session. Trying to outline AND write in one sitting leads to mushy structure. Also, your personal examples are your unfair advantage — Google has enough generic advice.

---

### 12. The Social Media Repurposer

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–30 minutes per piece of content

**When to use:** You've already created something (a blog post, podcast episode, newsletter, or video) and want to squeeze 5+ more pieces of content out of it.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
I have an existing piece of content I want to repurpose across multiple platforms.

Original content type: [BLOG POST / NEWSLETTER / PODCAST EPISODE / VIDEO / PRESENTATION]
Original content (paste below or summarize key points):
[PASTE THE CONTENT OR DETAILED SUMMARY]

My platforms: [LIST YOUR ACTIVE PLATFORMS — e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, newsletter]

Create the following from this single piece of content:

1. **Twitter/X thread** (5-7 tweets) — punchy, each tweet stands alone, thread flows logically
2. **LinkedIn post** — professional angle, story or insight format, 150-250 words
3. **Instagram caption** — casual, relatable, includes a call to action, under 200 words
4. **Email teaser** — 3-4 sentences to send to my list that makes them want to read/watch the original
5. **Quote graphics text** — 3 standalone quotes or stats from the content that would work as image overlays

For each piece:
- Adapt the tone to match the platform
- Don't just copy-paste sections — reimagine the content for that audience
- Include platform-specific CTAs
```

**💡 Pro tip:** This is how creators who seem "everywhere" actually do it — they create once and distribute many times. Schedule these across the week so it looks like you're constantly producing, when really you batched everything in one session.

# Part 4: The Client Acquisition Engine

Before diving into sales automations, you need a system — not just tactics.

## The Sales Flywheel for Solopreneurs

Most solopreneurs treat sales as a series of isolated events. Instead, build a flywheel:

```
ATTRACT → QUALIFY → CLOSE → DELIVER → DELIGHT → REFER → (back to ATTRACT)
```

Each stage feeds the next. Here's what breaks at each stage and how to fix it:

| Stage | What Breaks | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **Attract** | No one knows you exist | Consistent content + outreach (2-3 channels max) |
| **Qualify** | Spending time on bad-fit leads | Pre-qualifying questions before calls (see automation #14) |
| **Close** | Proposals that don't convert | Send within 24h, lead with understanding, present 3 tiers |
| **Deliver** | Scope creep, over-delivery | Clear SOW + weekly updates + boundary scripts (see #18) |
| **Delight** | Mediocre results or experience | Over-communicate, exceed on ONE unexpected thing |
| **Refer** | Not asking, or asking wrong | Ask within 48h of positive outcome, make it specific and easy |

## The "3-3-3" Client Acquisition Rule

To maintain a healthy pipeline without spending all day on sales:

- **3 pieces of content per week** (builds audience — Level 1 of your pricing ladder)
- **3 outreach messages per day** (direct prospecting — warm, not cold when possible)
- **3 follow-ups per week** (most deals close on the 2nd-5th touch, not the 1st)

This takes about 5-7 hours per week. Protect this time like it's a client deliverable — because your future revenue depends on it.

## Decision Tree: Should You Raise Your Prices?

```
START: Are you booked out more than 2 weeks in advance?
├── YES → Raise prices 20-30%. You're undercharging.
│   └── Did you lose any deals after raising? 
│       ├── Lost 0-10% → Raise again.
│       ├── Lost 10-30% → Perfect. You're now properly priced.
│       └── Lost 30%+ → You may have a positioning problem, not a pricing problem.
└── NO → Are you closing more than 50% of proposals?
    ├── YES → You need more leads, not lower prices. Focus on audience.
    └── NO → Is the objection usually about price specifically?
        ├── YES → Test value-based pricing (anchor to their ROI, not your hours)
        └── NO → The problem is likely trust or fit. Improve case studies and qualification.
```

### 13. The Proposal Writer

**⏱ Time saved:** 45–60 minutes per proposal

**When to use:** A potential client is interested and you need to send a proposal that closes the deal without spending half your day writing it.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Write a project proposal for a potential client.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
What I do: [YOUR SERVICE — e.g., "brand identity design for startups"]

Client: [CLIENT NAME / COMPANY]
What they need: [THEIR PROJECT — based on our conversation]
Their main pain point or goal: [WHAT'S DRIVING THIS PROJECT — e.g., "they're rebranding because their current look feels outdated and they're losing deals"]
Budget discussed (if any): [BUDGET RANGE or "not discussed yet"]
Timeline they mentioned: [DESIRED TIMELINE]

My proposed approach:
[YOUR ROUGH PLAN — e.g., "Discovery call, mood board, 2 concept options, 2 rounds of revisions, final delivery"]

Pricing: [YOUR PRICE AND STRUCTURE — e.g., "$3,500 split into 50% upfront and 50% on delivery"]

Write the proposal with these sections:
1. **Understanding** — Show I listened (restate their situation and goal in my words)
2. **Approach** — What I'll do and why (process, not just deliverables)
3. **Deliverables** — Specific list of what they get
4. **Timeline** — Phase-by-phase breakdown
5. **Investment** — Pricing with payment terms
6. **Why me** — 2-3 sentences on why I'm the right fit (confident, not braggy)
7. **Next steps** — Exactly what happens if they say yes

Keep it under 600 words. Confident, clear, no fluff. This should feel like a trusted expert laying out a plan, not a vendor begging for business.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Send proposals within 24 hours of the discovery call. Every day you wait, close rates drop. Also, the "Understanding" section does 80% of the selling — when clients feel deeply understood, price becomes secondary.

---

### 14. The Discovery Call Question Builder

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes per call prep

**When to use:** You have a sales call coming up and want to ask smart questions that uncover what the client really needs (and position you as the expert).

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Generate discovery call questions for an upcoming sales conversation.

My service: [WHAT YOU OFFER]
The prospect: [THEIR NAME, BUSINESS, AND WHAT LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM]
How they found me: [REFERRAL / WEBSITE / SOCIAL MEDIA / COLD OUTREACH]
What they initially said they need: [THEIR STATED REQUEST]

Create a call framework with:

1. **Rapport questions** (2-3) — Easy openers that show genuine interest in their business
2. **Situation questions** (3-4) — Understand their current state, what they've tried, what's working/not
3. **Pain questions** (3-4) — Dig into the real problem behind the request (what's it costing them to NOT solve this?)
4. **Vision questions** (2-3) — What does success look like? How will they know it worked?
5. **Logistics questions** (2-3) — Budget, timeline, decision-makers, deal-breakers
6. **Closing question** — One question that naturally transitions to next steps

For each question, add a [LISTEN FOR] note — what their answer reveals and how to use it.

Also include:
- 2 red flags to watch for (signs this might be a bad-fit client)
- 1 "power question" — a question most competitors won't think to ask
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Print this out (or keep it on a second screen) and check questions off as the conversation naturally covers them. Don't read them like a script — use them as a guide. The best discovery calls feel like conversations, not interrogations.

---

### 15. The Pricing Calculator Prompt

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–30 minutes per pricing decision

**When to use:** A new project request came in and you need to figure out what to charge without undervaluing yourself or pricing out of the market.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me price a new project.

My service: [WHAT YOU DO]
My experience level: [YEARS IN BUSINESS, NOTABLE CLIENTS OR RESULTS]
My usual rate: [YOUR TYPICAL RATE — hourly, project, retainer]

The project:
- Client: [CLIENT TYPE — e.g., "funded startup," "local small business," "Fortune 500 subsidiary"]
- Scope: [WHAT THEY NEED]
- Estimated hours of work: [YOUR BEST GUESS]
- Complexity: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH — and why]
- Timeline: [RUSH JOB? NORMAL? FLEXIBLE?]
- Value to the client: [WHAT THIS PROJECT IS WORTH TO THEIR BUSINESS — e.g., "this will be their entire customer-facing brand," "this saves them from hiring a $80K/year employee"]

Give me:
1. **Floor price** — The absolute minimum I should accept (with explanation)
2. **Target price** — What I should quote (with justification)
3. **Stretch price** — An ambitious-but-defensible price if the client has budget
4. **Pricing structure options** — 3 ways to package this (e.g., flat fee, tiered packages, retainer)
5. **Anchoring strategy** — How to present pricing so the middle option feels like a no-brainer
6. **What to say if they push back on price** — 2-3 responses to common objections

Factor in: rush fees if timeline is tight, value-based pricing if the impact is high, and the relationship value of this client for future work.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Always present three options (basic, recommended, premium). Clients who can't afford your recommended rate might still buy the basic. Clients with budget often upgrade to premium. You close more deals AND make more money.

### 16. The Client Onboarding Checklist Generator

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–25 minutes per new client

**When to use:** You just signed a new client and need a smooth onboarding process that makes you look professional and sets the project up for success.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create a client onboarding checklist and welcome email for a new project.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
Service I'm providing: [THE SPECIFIC SERVICE FOR THIS PROJECT]
Client: [CLIENT NAME / COMPANY]
Project scope: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
Project timeline: [START DATE TO END DATE]
Payment terms: [e.g., "50% upfront, 50% on delivery"]

Generate:

1. **Welcome email** that includes:
   - Warm but professional welcome
   - Summary of what we agreed on
   - What they need to provide (with specific deadlines)
   - What to expect in the first week
   - Best way to communicate and response time expectations
   - A link placeholder for [SCHEDULING LINK], [PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL], [CONTRACT/INVOICE]

2. **Onboarding checklist** (for my internal use) with:
   - Everything I need to collect from them (files, access, info)
   - Systems to set up (project folder, communication channel, tracking)
   - Templates to send (contract, invoice, brief)
   - First milestone and deadline
   - Reminder schedule for anything they haven't sent

3. **Client questionnaire** — 8-10 questions to send them that gather everything I need to start the project (specific to [YOUR SERVICE TYPE])
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Save the onboarding checklist as a template and reuse it for every new client. Customize 20%, keep 80% the same. Systemizing onboarding is one of the highest-leverage things a solopreneur can do — it eliminates the "where do I start?" feeling with every new project.

---

### 17. The Objection Handler Script

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes of prep (hours of lost deals)

**When to use:** You keep hearing the same objections from potential clients — "too expensive," "I need to think about it," "I'll do it myself" — and want ready responses that close instead of crumble.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create objection-handling scripts for my business.

My service: [WHAT YOU OFFER]
My typical price point: [YOUR USUAL PRICE RANGE]
My ideal client: [WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE]

Write response scripts for these common objections:

1. "That's more than I expected / too expensive"
2. "I need to think about it / talk to my [partner/team]"
3. "I found someone cheaper"
4. "Can we start with a smaller project first?"
5. "I'm not ready yet, maybe next quarter"
6. "Can you just do [SMALLER PIECE] instead of the full package?"
7. "What guarantee do I have this will work?"

For each objection, provide:
- **What they're really saying** (the fear or concern behind the words)
- **The wrong response** (what most people say that kills the deal)
- **The right response** (2-3 sentences — conversational, not scripted-sounding)
- **A follow-up question** to ask that moves the conversation forward

Also give me:
- 3 "pre-objection" statements I can use earlier in the conversation to prevent these objections from coming up at all
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Practice these out loud, not just reading them. The first time you hear "that's too expensive" and smoothly respond instead of panic-discounting, you'll make back the cost of this playbook 100x over.

---

### 18. The Scope Creep Boundary Setter

**⏱ Time saved:** 15 minutes of writing (potentially thousands in unbilled work)

**When to use:** A client is asking for things beyond the original agreement, and you need to address it professionally without damaging the relationship.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me address scope creep with a client.

Client: [CLIENT NAME]
Original project scope: [WHAT WE AGREED ON]
What they're now asking for: [THE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS]
How far along we are: [e.g., "60% complete," "just started phase 2"]
Our contract situation: [e.g., "We have a signed contract with clear scope," "It was a verbal agreement," "The contract is vague on this area"]
Relationship context: [e.g., "Great client, want to keep them happy," "Already difficult, need to be firm," "Big potential for future work"]
Am I willing to do the extra work? [YES — for additional fee / YES — as goodwill / NO]

Write:

1. **An email** addressing the additional requests that:
   - Acknowledges their request positively (they're not wrong for asking)
   - Clearly explains what was in the original scope
   - Presents options (additional fee for additional work, swap priorities, or phase 2)
   - Includes specific pricing for the additional work if I choose to offer it
   - Maintains a collaborative tone (we're solving this together)

2. **A "for next time" clause** — Contract language I should include in future agreements to prevent this specific type of scope creep
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Address scope creep the FIRST time it happens, not after it's been going on for weeks. Early conversations are easy and professional. Late conversations feel confrontational. A simple "Great idea — let me put together what that would look like as an add-on" reframes the whole dynamic.

# Part 5: AI Automations — Operations & Admin

---

### 19. The SOPs-From-Brain-Dump Creator

**⏱ Time saved:** 45–60 minutes per SOP

**When to use:** You do something repeatedly in your business and need to document the process so you can delegate it, systematize it, or just stop reinventing the wheel every time.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Turn my messy brain dump into a clear, step-by-step Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Process name: [e.g., "Client Onboarding," "Monthly Invoicing," "Social Media Posting"]

My brain dump of how I do this (stream of consciousness is fine):
[PASTE EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF ABOUT THIS PROCESS — steps, tools you use, things you always forget, tips, order of operations. Messy is fine.]

Tools/software involved: [LIST ANY APPS OR TOOLS — e.g., "Stripe, Google Drive, Canva, Calendly"]

Who will use this SOP: [JUST ME / A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT / A NEW HIRE / A CONTRACTOR]

Create:
1. **SOP title and purpose** (1 sentence on why this process exists)
2. **When to use** (trigger — what event kicks off this process)
3. **Time required** (estimated)
4. **Tools needed** (with links placeholders)
5. **Step-by-step instructions** — numbered, specific enough that someone doing it for the first time could follow along. Include:
   - Exact click-paths where relevant ("Go to Stripe → Customers → New")
   - Decision points ("IF the client is international, THEN...")
   - Common mistakes to avoid (flag with ⚠️)
6. **Quality checklist** — 5 things to verify before marking this process complete
7. **FAQ** — 3-4 "what if" scenarios and how to handle them
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Record a Loom video of yourself doing the process once, get the transcript, and use THAT as your brain dump. You'll capture steps you do unconsciously that you'd forget to write down.

---

### 20. The Invoice & Payment Reminder Sequence

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes per overdue invoice

**When to use:** A client's payment is due (or overdue) and you need professional, escalating reminders that get you paid without being awkward.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create a payment reminder email sequence for an outstanding invoice.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
Client: [CLIENT NAME]
Invoice amount: [AMOUNT]
Invoice date: [DATE SENT]
Payment was due: [DUE DATE]
Days overdue: [NUMBER]
Payment method: [HOW THEY CAN PAY — e.g., "bank transfer, Stripe link, PayPal"]
Our relationship: [e.g., "Repeat client, normally pays on time" / "New client, first invoice" / "Has been late before"]

Create 4 emails in an escalating sequence:

1. **Friendly reminder** (send day payment is due) — casual, assumes they forgot, no pressure
2. **Gentle follow-up** (send 7 days overdue) — still warm, but clear that payment is outstanding
3. **Firm reminder** (send 14 days overdue) — professional, references terms, asks for a specific response date
4. **Final notice** (send 30 days overdue) — serious tone, mentions consequences (pause work, late fees, collections), still respectful

For each email, include:
- Subject line
- Body (under 100 words each)
- The one sentence that does the heavy lifting in each email
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Set up these emails as templates in your email tool and schedule them the moment you send an invoice. Automated follow-ups mean you never have to "work up the courage" to chase payment — the system does it for you.

---

### 21. The Weekly CEO Review Prompt

**⏱ Time saved:** 25–30 minutes per week

**When to use:** End of the week. You need to step back from doing the work and actually review how your business is performing — revenue, priorities, what's working, what's not.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me run my weekly business review. I'm going to dump my week's data and I want you to help me think like a CEO, not just a doer.

Revenue this week: [AMOUNT or "none"]
Revenue this month (running total): [AMOUNT]
Monthly revenue target: [TARGET]

What I worked on this week:
[LIST YOUR MAIN ACTIVITIES — e.g., "3 client deliverables, wrote 2 blog posts, had 4 sales calls, invoiced $2,000"]

Wins:
[ANYTHING THAT WENT WELL]

Frustrations or problems:
[ANYTHING THAT DIDN'T GO WELL]

Pipeline (potential deals in progress):
[LIST ANY LEADS, PROPOSALS OUT, CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING]

Based on this, give me:
1. **Revenue check** — Am I on track for my monthly goal? What's the gap?
2. **Time audit** — Was I spending time on high-value activities or getting pulled into low-value work?
3. **Pipeline health** — Do I have enough leads? What should I do this week to fill the pipeline?
4. **The ONE thing** — What is the single most important thing I should focus on next week?
5. **Honest feedback** — Be direct. What pattern do you see that I might be ignoring?
6. **Next week's top 3 priorities** — Based on everything above
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Do this every Friday at the same time. Block 30 minutes on your calendar. The solopreneurs who grow are the ones who review weekly. The ones who stay stuck are the ones who just keep "doing" without stepping back.

---

### 22. The Contract Clause Explainer

**⏱ Time saved:** 20–30 minutes per contract review

**When to use:** You received a contract from a client or vendor and want to understand what you're agreeing to before signing — without paying a lawyer for a basic review.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
I need help understanding a contract I've been sent. I'm not a lawyer, so explain everything in plain English.

Context: [WHO SENT THIS — e.g., "A client wants me to sign this before starting a $5,000 web design project"]

Here's the contract text (or the sections I'm unsure about):
[PASTE THE CONTRACT TEXT OR SPECIFIC CLAUSES]

For each major clause, tell me:
1. **What it means** in plain English (like you're explaining to a friend)
2. **Is this standard?** — Normal for this type of agreement, or unusual?
3. **Risk level** — 🟢 Fine / 🟡 Worth discussing / 🔴 Get this changed before signing
4. **What could go wrong** — Worst-case scenario if this clause is enforced against me

Also flag:
- Anything that's missing (common protections I should ask to add)
- Any clause that's one-sided in their favor
- Recommended changes I could propose (give me the language)

⚠️ Important: I understand this is not legal advice. For anything flagged 🔴, I'll consult an actual lawyer. I'm using this to understand the basics and know what questions to ask.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Never sign a contract you don't fully understand, but also don't let "I should have a lawyer look at this" become an excuse to delay for weeks. Use this prompt for a quick first pass, then only engage a lawyer for the red flags. Time and money saved.

---

### 23. The Expense Categorizer & Tax Prep Helper

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–45 minutes per month

**When to use:** End of the month (or tax season panic) — you need to categorize a pile of business expenses and make sure nothing deductible falls through the cracks.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me categorize my business expenses for [MONTH/YEAR].

My business type: [e.g., "Freelance copywriter, sole proprietor, based in the US"]
I work from: [HOME OFFICE / CO-WORKING SPACE / CLIENT SITES / MIX]

Here are my expenses (paste bank/credit card transactions):
[PASTE YOUR TRANSACTION LIST — dates, amounts, descriptions]

For each expense:
1. **Category** — (e.g., Software/SaaS, Marketing, Office Supplies, Professional Development, Travel, Meals, Contractor Payments, Insurance, Home Office)
2. **Tax deductible?** — Yes / Partial / No / Possibly (with explanation)
3. **Notes** — Anything I should document for tax purposes (receipts to save, business purpose to note)

After categorizing, give me:
- **Summary table** — Total spend per category
- **Top 3 deductions I might be missing** — Common write-offs for [MY BUSINESS TYPE] that I should look for
- **Red flags** — Any expenses that might trigger questions if audited (and how to document them properly)

⚠️ Note: I know this isn't tax advice. I'll share this with my accountant. This is to help me stay organized and walk in prepared.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Do this monthly, not annually. 12 small sessions beats one frantic weekend in April. Export your transactions as CSV from your bank — paste the whole thing in and let AI sort through it. Your future self (and your accountant) will thank you.

---

### 24. The Email Template Builder

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–40 minutes upfront (saves hours over time)

**When to use:** You keep writing the same types of emails over and over. Time to create reusable templates you can fire off in 30 seconds with minor customization.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Create a set of reusable email templates for my business.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME] — [WHAT YOU DO]
My typical clients: [WHO THEY ARE]
My tone: [e.g., "friendly professional — warm but not overly casual"]

Create templates for these 8 common scenarios:

1. **Initial inquiry response** — Someone reached out asking about my services
2. **Meeting scheduling** — Setting up a call with a lead or client
3. **Project kickoff** — We're starting, here's what happens next
4. **Requesting feedback/approval** — Sending work for client review
5. **Project delay notification** — Something is running behind schedule
6. **Project completion** — Deliverables are done, here's everything
7. **Thank you / post-project** — Wrapping up the relationship warmly
8. **Re-engagement** — Haven't heard from a past client in a while

For each template:
- Subject line
- Body with [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked for customization
- Keep each under 150 words
- Include a specific call-to-action
- Make them sound human, not corporate

Format them so I can copy each one directly into my email tool's template/canned response feature.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Load these into Gmail's "Templates" feature (Settings → Advanced → Templates) or your email tool's canned responses. You'll go from writing 15-minute emails to sending 30-second personalized templates. This one automation alone can save 2+ hours per week.

# Part 6: Strategic Thinking Frameworks

The automations below help you think through business decisions. But frameworks are more valuable than prompts for strategic work. Here are three you should internalize:

## Framework 1: The Regret Minimization Test

Before any big business decision, ask: *"In 5 years, will I regret NOT doing this?"*

This cuts through analysis paralysis. Most solopreneurs over-optimize small decisions (which email tool? what color logo?) and under-think big ones (should I niche down? should I fire this client? should I double my prices?).

**Apply it to:**
- Turning down a well-paying but soul-crushing client
- Launching a product before it's "perfect"
- Raising prices and potentially losing some clients
- Investing in yourself (courses, coaching, tools)

## Framework 2: The 70% Rule

Make decisions when you have 70% of the information you wish you had. Less than 70% is reckless. More than 70% means you're stalling.

Solopreneurs who wait for certainty get lapped by those who move at 70% and course-correct. Your advantage as a one-person business is SPEED — don't give it up trying to eliminate all risk.

## Framework 3: The "Hell Yes or No" Filter

If an opportunity isn't a "hell yes," it's a no. This applies to:
- Client projects ("interesting but not exciting" = no)
- Collaborations ("might be cool" = no)
- Tools and platforms ("everyone's using it" = not a reason)

The exception: when you're in survival mode (pre-$3K/month), take what pays. Once you've got baseline revenue, this filter becomes your most powerful growth tool. Every mediocre "yes" blocks a great opportunity from fitting into your calendar.

### 25. The Business Model Stress Test

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–45 minutes of strategic thinking

**When to use:** You want to pressure-test your current business model — or evaluate a new direction — and need a thinking partner who won't just tell you what you want to hear.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Stress-test my business model. Be honest, not encouraging. I need to see the weak spots.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
What I sell: [PRODUCTS/SERVICES AND PRICE POINTS]
How I get clients: [YOUR MAIN CLIENT ACQUISITION CHANNELS]
Current monthly revenue: [APPROXIMATE RANGE]
Revenue goal: [TARGET AND TIMELINE]
How many hours I work per week: [HONEST ESTIMATE]
My biggest expense: [WHAT COSTS THE MOST]
What I think my biggest advantage is: [YOUR COMPETITIVE EDGE]

Analyze my business across these dimensions:

1. **Revenue math** — Is my goal realistic with my current pricing and capacity? Show me the math.
2. **Single points of failure** — What could break this business tomorrow? (One client leaves, a platform changes, I get sick for a month)
3. **Scalability ceiling** — Where does this model hit a wall? What's the maximum this can earn before I need to change something?
4. **Competitive vulnerability** — How easily could someone replicate what I do? What protects me?
5. **Client dependency** — Am I too dependent on too few clients or one acquisition channel?
6. **Pricing analysis** — Am I leaving money on the table? Where?
7. **Time-for-money trap** — Am I building equity or just trading hours for dollars?

End with:
- The #1 risk I should address this month
- The #1 opportunity I'm probably not seeing
- One structural change that would make this business more resilient
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Run this quarterly with updated numbers. The first time might sting — that's the point. Most solopreneurs avoid this kind of honest analysis, which is exactly why they stay stuck. Clarity is the shortcut.

---

### 26. The "Should I Take This Client?" Decision Framework

**⏱ Time saved:** 15–20 minutes (plus potential weeks of regret avoided)

**When to use:** A potential client wants to work with you and you're not sure if it's a good fit. Your gut says something but you can't articulate what.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me decide whether to take on a potential client. Play devil's advocate.

The opportunity:
- Client: [WHO THEY ARE]
- Project: [WHAT THEY WANT]
- Budget: [WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY]
- Timeline: [WHEN THEY NEED IT]
- How they found me: [REFERRAL / COLD / INBOUND]

My current situation:
- Current workload: [LIGHT / COMFORTABLE / HEAVY / OVERLOADED]
- Monthly revenue right now: [AMOUNT]
- Do I need this money? [BE HONEST]
- How excited am I about this project? (1-10): [NUMBER]
- My gut feeling: [DESCRIBE IT — e.g., "something feels off but the money is good"]

Red flags I've noticed (if any):
[LIST ANYTHING — slow to respond, haggled on price, vague requirements, rude to my assistant, etc.]

Analyze this opportunity:
1. **Financial impact** — Is the money worth the time and energy?
2. **Opportunity cost** — What can't I do if I take this? What might I miss?
3. **Client quality score** — Based on what I've described, rate this client 1-10 with reasoning
4. **Red flag analysis** — Are the red flags dealbreakers or manageable?
5. **Best case scenario** — If everything goes perfectly
6. **Worst case scenario** — If everything goes wrong
7. **My recommendation** — Take it / Negotiate changes / Walk away (with reasoning)

If you recommend I take it, tell me what boundaries to set upfront.
If you recommend I walk away, give me a polite decline script.
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Your gut is usually right — this prompt helps you understand WHY it's right. The most expensive clients aren't the ones who pay the least; they're the ones who drain your energy and crowd out better opportunities. Learn to say no profitably.

---

### 27. The Offer Creation Workshop

**⏱ Time saved:** 60–90 minutes of strategic planning

**When to use:** You want to create a new offer — a package, productized service, course, or digital product — and need to think through positioning, pricing, and packaging.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me design a new offer for my business.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME] — [WHAT YOU DO]
My existing offers: [LIST CURRENT SERVICES/PRODUCTS AND PRICES]
My target audience: [WHO I SERVE]

The new offer idea: [DESCRIBE YOUR ROUGH CONCEPT — e.g., "a done-for-you social media setup package," "a group coaching program," "a templates bundle"]

What problem does this solve: [THE PAIN POINT]
Why I want to create this: [e.g., "passive income," "serve more people at a lower price point," "stop trading time for money"]

Help me build this out:

1. **Offer name** — 3 options (clear beats clever)
2. **One-line description** — What it is, who it's for, what outcome they get
3. **What's included** — Specific deliverables, organized into a package that feels valuable
4. **Pricing strategy** — Recommended price with reasoning, comparison to alternatives, and perceived value analysis
5. **Tier structure** — If applicable, design 3 tiers (Good / Better / Best)
6. **Unique mechanism** — What makes my approach different from similar offers? (Help me find or create my unique angle)
7. **Objection anticipation** — Top 3 reasons someone wouldn't buy, and how the offer design addresses each
8. **Launch plan** — A simple 2-week launch sequence (what to do and say each day)
9. **Validation check** — 3 ways to test demand before I build the whole thing
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Validation before creation. Always. Run idea #9 first — pre-sell it, survey your audience, or offer it to 3 past clients at a discount. Building something nobody wants is the most expensive mistake in business.

---

### 28. The Competitor Analysis Deep Dive

**⏱ Time saved:** 45–60 minutes of research

**When to use:** You want to understand your competitive landscape — who else does what you do, how they position themselves, and where your opportunity lies.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me analyze my competitive landscape.

My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME]
What I do: [YOUR SERVICE/PRODUCT]
My target market: [WHO I SERVE]
My pricing: [YOUR PRICE RANGE]
My main differentiator (what I think sets me apart): [YOUR UNIQUE ANGLE]

Competitors I know about:
1. [COMPETITOR 1 — name, URL if available, what they offer]
2. [COMPETITOR 2]
3. [COMPETITOR 3]
(Add more if you have them, or say "I don't know my competitors well")

Analyze:

1. **Positioning map** — Where does each competitor sit in terms of price vs. specialization? Where do I sit?
2. **Gap analysis** — What is NO ONE in my space doing that clients probably want?
3. **Messaging comparison** — What language/claims do competitors use? What angles are overused?
4. **Pricing intelligence** — How does my pricing compare? Am I premium, mid-market, or budget?
5. **Strength theft** — What are competitors doing well that I should learn from (without copying)?
6. **Weakness exploitation** — Where are competitors falling short that I can capitalize on?
7. **Blue ocean opportunity** — Is there a way to redefine my category so I'm not competing head-to-head at all?

Give me:
- A clear positioning statement that differentiates me
- 3 messaging angles my competitors aren't using
- 1 strategic move I could make this month to stand out
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Don't just do this once — revisit every quarter. Markets shift, competitors launch new things, and opportunities appear. Also, your BEST competitive intelligence comes from clients who almost hired someone else. Always ask: "Who else were you considering and why did you choose me?"

---

### 29. The Annual Planning / Goal Setting Session

**⏱ Time saved:** 60–90 minutes of planning

**When to use:** It's planning season (or you feel lost and need to reset direction). You need clear goals, realistic targets, and an actual plan — not just vague intentions.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
Help me create my business plan for [YEAR/QUARTER].

Where I am now:
- Monthly revenue (average): [AMOUNT]
- Main income sources: [LIST THEM WITH PERCENTAGES — e.g., "Client work 80%, digital products 15%, affiliate 5%"]
- Number of active clients: [NUMBER]
- Hours I work per week: [HONEST NUMBER]
- What's working well: [LIST 2-3 THINGS]
- What's not working: [LIST 2-3 THINGS]
- My biggest bottleneck: [WHAT'S HOLDING ME BACK]

Where I want to be at the end of [YEAR/QUARTER]:
- Revenue goal: [TARGET]
- Lifestyle goal: [e.g., "work 30 hours/week," "take 2 weeks off," "hire help"]
- Business goal: [e.g., "launch a course," "hit 1,000 email subscribers," "land 2 retainer clients"]
- Skill goal: [SOMETHING I WANT TO LEARN OR IMPROVE]

Create my plan:

1. **Reality check** — Is my revenue goal realistic given where I am? If not, what's a stretch-but-achievable target?
2. **Revenue roadmap** — How exactly will I hit my target? Break it down by income stream, client count, and pricing needed.
3. **Quarterly milestones** — What should be true at the end of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4?
4. **Monthly focus areas** — One primary focus per month for the next 6 months
5. **Key metrics to track** — 5 numbers I should review weekly
6. **Experiments to run** — 3 low-risk things to test in the first 90 days
7. **What to stop doing** — Activities, clients, or habits I should drop
8. **What to start doing** — New activities or habits to add
9. **Accountability system** — How to stay on track (specific, not just "review monthly")
```

**💡 Pro tip:** Share your plan with one person — an accountability partner, a mastermind group, or even just a friend who'll ask you hard questions. Plans that stay in your head (or on your hard drive) are just wishes. Plans that get shared become commitments.

### 30. The "Thinking Partner" Problem Solver

**⏱ Time saved:** 30–60 minutes of spinning your wheels

**When to use:** You're stuck on a business problem and need to think it through with someone who asks good questions and offers fresh perspectives. This is your AI advisor on-demand.

**Works with:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

**The prompt:**
```
I need a thinking partner. I'm stuck on a business problem and want to work through it.

The problem or decision: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE WRESTLING WITH — e.g., "I don't know whether to raise my prices or keep them the same and try to get more clients," "I'm burned out but can't afford to slow down," "A competitor just launched something similar to my new offer"]

Context:
- My business: [YOUR BUSINESS NAME — WHAT YOU DO]
- How long I've been thinking about this: [TIME]
- What I've already considered or tried: [YOUR CURRENT THINKING]
- What's making this hard: [WHY YOU HAVEN'T DECIDED — fear, uncertainty, tradeoffs, conflicting advice]
- What's at stake: [WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET THIS WRONG]

Don't just give me advice. Instead:

1. **Reframe the problem** — Am I even asking the right question? Is there a deeper issue here?
2. **Challenge my assumptions** — What am I taking for granted that might not be true?
3. **Show me the tradeoffs** — For each option, what do I gain and what do I give up? (Be specific)
4. **Give me a mental model** — Is there a framework or analogy that makes this clearer?
5. **Ask me 3 questions** — Questions I haven't asked myself that might unlock the answer
6. **The 10/10/10 test** — How will I feel about each option 10 minutes / 10 months / 10 years from now?
7. **Your recommendation** — If you HAD to choose for me, what would you do and why?
8. **Smallest next step** — What's one thing I can do TODAY to make progress, even if I haven't fully decided?
```

**💡 Pro tip:** The best part of AI as a thinking partner: you can be 100% honest with no ego management. You can say "I'm scared," "I'm procrastinating," "I know I should fire this client but I need the money." The more honest your input, the more useful the output. There's no judgment here — just clarity.

# Part 7: How to Get the Most Out of This Playbook

## The 3-Step Implementation Plan

**Week 1: Foundation**
1. Work through the 4-Lever Framework (Part 1). Identify your current bottleneck.
2. Do the Revenue Math. Know your actual numbers.
3. Pick 3 automations that address your bottleneck. Use those this week.

**Week 2: Systems**
1. Time-audit yourself using the Time-Value Matrix.
2. Build your first SOP using automation #19.
3. Set up your client acquisition rhythm (the 3-3-3 rule from Part 4).

**Week 3+: Optimization**
1. Run your Weekly CEO Review (#21) every Friday.
2. Stress-test your business model quarterly (#25).
3. Gradually add automations as you need them — not all at once.

## Key Principles

- **Customize the placeholders.** These prompts work 10x better with specific details about YOUR business.
- **Iterate, don't restart.** Tell the AI what to change: "shorter," "more casual," "add numbers." The second draft is almost always what you need.
- **Stack automations.** Use #14 (Discovery Call Questions) before the call → #13 (Proposal Writer) after → #16 (Client Onboarding) when they sign → #5 (Client Update Email) weekly throughout.
- **Strategy before tactics.** The frameworks in Parts 1, 4, and 6 are worth more than all the prompts combined. Revisit them monthly.
